# Curriculum vitae of Artur Lidtke

The file you are looking for is called `cv.pdf`. There's also a list of all my publications, together with abstracts and full citation details,
in `publicationList.pdf`. If you are looking for the bibtex citation data for any one of the publications, have a look at `myPublications.bib`. You
may find all the pdfs I'm allowed to share on my Research Gate (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Artur-Lidtke). If anything is missing
and you'd like to read it, feel free to contact me directly.
