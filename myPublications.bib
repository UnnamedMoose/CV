    abstract = {The mechanism of bubble capture in a vortical flow is investigated using a Lagrangian bubble tracking method. The motion of bubbles and the factors influencing their movement are examined. Detailed analysis is conducted on the roles played by each force component, such as the lift, added mass, and centrifugal forces, in the bubble capture process. An interesting finding is the identification of the stabilizing effect of the azimuthal lift force on the bubble capture mechanism. Furthermore, a model for capture time based on the radial force balance is also developed, and validated with existing experimental data. These findings, including the force mechanism and capture time model, provide a foundation for understanding the bubble capture process and can potentially inform future studies on tip vortex cavitation inception such as determining the cavitation hotspot.}

    abstract = {Turbulence induces unsteady loads on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and may present a significant navigation challenge. This leads to elevated risks of mission failure or vehicle damage in proximity to obstacles. A scenario of particular interest is inspection of offshore structures that needs to be carried out at short range inside a turbulent wake. This work presents a control strategy based on reinforcement learning (RL) that has been designed to handle such a complex manoeuvring scenario. Training and evaluation is carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a simplified 2D geometry of similar manoeuvring characteristics to that of an AUV moving in the horizontal plane. Due to the high cost of the simulations, substantial emphasis has been placed on improving sampling efficiency of RL training using experience transfer from a computationally less demanding environment and quicker filling of the replay buffer by applying geometric transformations to the observations. The agent can navigate not only in the training environment, but also in a previously unseen flow generated by a large circular cylinder immersed in a current. The developed control strategy has also been interfaced with a path-following algorithm that allowed the controlled vehicle to carry out an inspection task.}

	doi = {10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111176},
	abstract = {There is increasing awareness about the harmful impact of underwater radiated noise of shipping on the marine environment, with propeller cavitation being a major contributor thereof. In order to allow low-noise propeller design, reliable and validated numerical tools are necessary. The combined use of viscous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy has long been suggested as a potential frontrunner that could address this need. However, few studies presented in the open literature have shown detailed validation focused on farfield radiated noise of propellers in cavitating conditions. Present work aims to address this by applying the methodology to two thrusters operating in off-design conditions and tested at model scale. Flow is computed using scale-resolving CFD simulations and a mass-transfer cavitation model. This allows for part of the turbulence spectrum and cavitation dynamics to be resolved. It is shown that peak sound pressure levels, corresponding to the low-frequency underwater radiated noise source, may be predicted to within 5 dB of experimental results. In addition, key features of the noise spectra, such as centre frequency of the peak broadband noise level and decay slope, are also well represented in the computations. The results are supplemented by analysis of the numerical signal-to-noise ratio.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern about the impact of underwater radiated noise (URN) on marine life. One of the main sources of URN of ships is propeller cavitation. Semi-empirical computational models to predict back (suction) side cavitation at the design point of open propellers have been published, but there is a lack of models that predict the URN of open propellers in off-design conditions and the URN of ducted propellers, such as thrusters. The European Union NAVAIS 1 project considered two ship types that spend large proportions of time operating at off-design conditions-a road ferry and an aquaculture workboat-and are therefore likely to experience several different forms of propeller cavitation. The present paper discusses new semi-empirical models to be used together with a boundary element method for predicting noise from these forms of cavitation. The new (medium-fidelity) models were tuned using data from a large series of model-scale noise measurements, supplemented by high-fidelity scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics simulations combined with the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy. The medium-fidelity models were used to predict the URN from a large series of propellers for a wide range of operating conditions, with the results used in a regression analysis to develop a low-fidelity tool for estimating propeller URN of road ferries and workboats during the concept design phase.},

	abstract = {Incompressible large eddy simulations of the flow over an airfoil at high Reynolds number and low Mach number have been performed, including simulation of bypass transition to turbulence, and trailing-edge noise predictions. Extensive data comparison and validation has been carried out, using benchmark data and additional results from literature. Three semi-analytical noise models - Curle's acoustic analogy, the Ffowcs Williams-Hall (FW-Hall) model, and Amiet's model - were applied, with the sensitivity of the results to the hydrodynamic input data investigated. Overall, a good agreement was found between experimental and numerical results in terms of hydrodynamics. The main discrepancies were an overprediction of the Reynolds stresses close to the wall, and the high-frequency part of the turbulent wall pressure spectrum, both at the trailing edge. It is hypothesised that this is caused by the underresolved transition of the boundary layer. In terms of the acoustic predictions, the FW-Hall and Amiet models perform better than Curle’s analogy, with Amiet giving the best agreement with measurements below 2 kHz, and FW-Hall being superior above this frequency, with the latter model identified as being less sensitive to the aforementioned errors in the hydrodynamic results.},

	title = {Quantifying the effect of turbulence intensity on turbulence-interaction noise of an airfoil using scale-resolving simulations},
	abstract = {Noise pollution from ships is known to negatively impact wildlife. It is the low-frequency broadband noise component that can travel over large distances and is mostly relevant for marine wildlife. In the absence of cavitation, such as for tidal turbines, naval surface vessels and submarines, the low-frequency noise component is dominated by the interaction of the body with a turbulent inflow. The inflow turbulence generates pressure fluctuations on and near the surface of the body, thereby radiating sound to the far-field. This turbulence-interaction phenomenon is not fully understood yet. The semi-analytical model by Amiet (1975) can be used to predict far-field turbulence-interaction noise for an airfoil, which predicts the far-field sound pressure level (S PL) as a function of the square of the turbulence intensity (TI). Amiet’s model, however, does not account for the geometrical properties of the airfoil. This work presents the results of a numerical study that aims to determine the effect of the turbulence intensity on the far-field turbulence-interaction noise for a NACA0008 airfoil. A comparison of the numerically predicted far-field noise to Amiet’s work is performed to evaluate the accuracy of Amiet for different receiver angles. The Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (1969) (FW-H) acoustic analogy, which separates the generation and propagation of the sound, is adopted to estimate the SPL. Validation of the inflow turbulence and generated sound are performed by comparing one of the cases to a published experimental and numerical investigation for the same airfoil.},

	title = {Quantifying uncertainties in numerical predictions of dynamic cavitation},
	abstract = {Cavitation on marine propellers is an important issue due to its negative effects on many aspects of their operation. Therefore, accurate prediction of cavitation is important to ensure better propeller design. Estimating the cavitation behavior numerically is a~difficult task due to the high computational cost of simulations and various numerical uncertainties. This study is carried out in order to estimate the parameter and discretization uncertainties and combine them into a~single value using an example 2D foil as the test case. Angle of attack and the cavitation number are selected as input parameters and their influence on force coefficients and sheet cavity properties is studied. Sobol indices are also obtained to measure the relative importance of the input and discretization uncertainties. It is seen that uncertainty in the angle of attack has a~much greater influence on the force coefficients than the uncertainty in the cavitation number or grid discretization uncertainty. On the other hand, the cavitation number uncertainty is dominant over the grid and angle of attack uncertainties for the length and volume of the cavity sheet. According to the results obtained, applying only the grid refinement studies is not sufficient for the estimation of the numerical uncertainties for this kind of CFD problems. It is proposed that assessing both parameter and discretization uncertainties for the presented and other similar applications with epistemic uncertainties should be applied more often.},

	title = {Combining deep reinforcement learning and computational fluid dynamics for efficient navigation in turbulent flows},
	abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) face significant challenges when navigating in turbulent environments, particularly when carrying out tasks such as inspecting offshore structures that generate large turbulent wakes. These environments increase the risk of collision and damage, and decrease the success rate of recorded video frames, but carrying out such inspections with AUV offers large potential cost savings and reduced risk to human operators. Reinforcement learning (RL) combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can help develop control strategies suitable for handling such complex navigation problems. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of such approach. To this end, two versions of the soft actor-critic algorithm are tested: one relying on the estimated vehicle position and velocity and the other augmented with pressure surface measurements obtained from fitting the vehicle with simulated pressure transducers. Both RL agents successfully navigate in turbulent flows, but the agent provided with force estimates deduced from the surface pressure has significantly improved performance. This improvement is seen in the quality of individual episodes as well as in the training robustness and speed. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of using RL agents to assimilate additional information for developing robust control strategies and shows the usefulness of training RL agents in high-fidelity environments, such as CFD simulations.},
